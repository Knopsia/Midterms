               <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Geopolymer bricks provides a sustainable alternative to the standard fired bricks we commonly use today. There is a study, that study prove that the manufacturing cost of geopolymer bricks provides an economic gain of 5% compared to common fired bricks for the same compressive strength of 20 MPa. In the case of waste bricks, for the same production cost, the compressive strength of the geopolymer bricks is doubled the strength of fired bricks. Hence, the study shows the economic interest in the industrial production of geopolymer bricks. It also confirms that future research is needed that focuses on necessary changes to the current industrial production chain required for the manufacture of geopolymer bricks (Youssef et al., 2020).

               <br>
               &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;With our fast-growing economy, buildings are fast rising, the market research shows that geopolymer bricks have a lot of opportunity for variety of industries, that are real estate, business, infrastructure projects. The construction industries are switching and focusing on the geopolymer bricks value proposition because of their sustainability, making them an affordable product. The production of geopolymer concrete also will significantly lower the carbon dioxide emissions compared to traditional Portland cement-based concrete, this will provide economic growth, plus environmental benefit.
